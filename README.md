# AI Safety Research Frameworks

This repository contains frameworks, methodologies, and a theoretical testbed designed to evaluate safety risks in advanced reasoning AI models. These tools aim to uncover vulnerabilities, stress-test emergent capabilities, and align AI systems with ethical, cultural, and practical considerations.

## Key Components
- **Frameworks:** Tools like Meta-Resonance and S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. for multidimensional AI evaluation.
- **Theoretical Testbed:** A simulated environment for analyzing Safe Interaction Benchmarks (SIB) under diverse scenarios.
- **Sample Code:** Scripts to prototype and demonstrate AI safety evaluations.

- ## Safe Interaction Benchmarks (SIB)

Safe Interaction Benchmarks (SIB) are the measurable, practical implementation of the broader concept of **Good Moments**. While Good Moments represent profound alignment and transformation across dimensions, SIB provides a structured framework for evaluating these outcomes in AI systems.

SIB evaluates AI alignment across:
- **Physical:** Real-world outcomes.
- **Digital:** Transparency in decision-making.
- **Emotional:** Resonance with user trust.
- **Symbolic:** Cultural and societal alignment.
- **Metaphysical:** Ethical and long-term impact.

Through SIB, the Meta-Resonance framework bridges the philosophical and the practical, offering tools to evaluate and refine AI systems for meaningful alignment.

## About Me
This repository is maintained by The Derbied One, a multidisciplinary creative and researcher. My work bridges cultural storytelling, systemic evaluation, and innovative AI safety practices.

## Goals
- To develop robust evaluations for frontier models.
- To explore AI safety in multicultural and creative contexts.
- To contribute to OpenAI's safety research initiatives.
