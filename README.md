# AI Safety Research Frameworks

This repository contains frameworks, methodologies, and a theoretical testbed designed to evaluate safety risks in advanced reasoning AI models. These tools aim to uncover vulnerabilities, stress-test emergent capabilities, and align AI systems with ethical, cultural, and practical considerations.

## Key Components
- **Frameworks:** Tools like Meta-Resonance and S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. for multidimensional AI evaluation.
- **Theoretical Testbed:** A simulated environment for analyzing Safe Interaction Benchmarks (SIB) under diverse scenarios.
- **Sample Code:** Scripts to prototype and demonstrate AI safety evaluations.

## About Me
This repository is maintained by The Derbied One, a multidisciplinary creative and researcher. My work bridges cultural storytelling, systemic evaluation, and innovative AI safety practices.

## Goals
- To develop robust evaluations for frontier models.
- To explore AI safety in multicultural and creative contexts.
- To contribute to OpenAI's safety research initiatives.
