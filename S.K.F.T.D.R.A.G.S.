# S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. Framework (proonounced Skef-tee-drags)

## Overview
The S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. framework analyzes AI decision-making through spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover patterns, risks, and alignment opportunities.
## Origins and Dual Purpose

The **S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. Framework** was originally developed as a creative methodology to guide decision-making in storytelling, film, and art. By analyzing spatial and temporal dimensions, it helped creators make intentional, layered choices that resonated emotionally and thematically.

Its principles have since been adapted for technical applications, particularly in evaluating AI systems. This dual purpose ensures the framework remains versatile, serving as both a creative guide and a tool for uncovering risks, patterns, and alignment opportunities in dynamic environments.

## Components
1. **Spatial Relationship:** The proximity and positioning of elements in an environment, influencing outcomes.
2. **Kinesthetic Response:** AI’s reaction to movement, changes, or stimuli.
3. **Floor Patterns (Topography):** Pathways and layouts that guide navigation or behavior.
4. **Tempo:** The speed and rhythm of actions or decisions.
5. **Duration:** How long an AI maintains focus or an action.
6. **Repetition:** Recurring actions or motifs and their implications.
7. **Architecture:** Structural elements affecting decisions and their alignment.
8. **Gesture:** Symbolic or practical movements affecting outcomes.
9. **Shape:** Visual and conceptual outlines influencing mood or direction.

## Application
- Testing AI’s ability to process dynamic environments.
- Evaluating behavior under spatial or temporal constraints.
- Uncovering risks tied to repetitive or symbolic patterns.
