# S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. Framework (proonounced Skef-tee-drags)

## Overview
The S.K.F.T.D.R.A.G.S. framework analyzes AI decision-making through spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover patterns, risks, and alignment opportunities.

## Components
1. **Spatial Relationship:** The proximity and positioning of elements in an environment, influencing outcomes.
2. **Kinesthetic Response:** AI’s reaction to movement, changes, or stimuli.
3. **Floor Patterns (Topography):** Pathways and layouts that guide navigation or behavior.
4. **Tempo:** The speed and rhythm of actions or decisions.
5. **Duration:** How long an AI maintains focus or an action.
6. **Repetition:** Recurring actions or motifs and their implications.
7. **Architecture:** Structural elements affecting decisions and their alignment.
8. **Gesture:** Symbolic or practical movements affecting outcomes.
9. **Shape:** Visual and conceptual outlines influencing mood or direction.

## Application
- Testing AI’s ability to process dynamic environments.
- Evaluating behavior under spatial or temporal constraints.
- Uncovering risks tied to repetitive or symbolic patterns.
